# Pokédex!
As part of *Northcoders' Skills Bootcamp in Software Development*, we were tasked with creating an interactive app from scratch to visualise data from any API - my choice being [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Note that newer Pokémon may be lacking data.

This app can be viewed at:

## Navigation
Upon successfully searching a Pokémon name, an info display will pop up which is collapsible by clicking the red heading.  
The info shown is as follows:
- Normal and shiny sprites (which can be clicked to make a sound and spin around)
- Pokédex number and Pokémon name
- Types
- Height and weight
- Base stats (collapsible)
- Moves learned at certain levels (collapsible)
- Moves learned through machine (collapsible)
